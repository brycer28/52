**52!**

52 is a card game suite designed to house a small selections of card games I intend to create/develop over time. This was originally an idea from my OOP-Java course I took at University of Central Arkansas but I decided to start fresh for a better, more cohesive product

The suite features a menu where the user may select their desired game, which will create an instance of each game in which the player may play until they decide to quit

**Future Features:**
- Progress Tracking
- Color Themes
- Deck Theme Selection
- More Games
